       <center> <p>Down the street you can hear her scream "you're a disgrace"
            As she slams the door in his drunken face,
            And now he stands outside
            And all the neighbors start to gossip and drool<br>
            He cries "Oh girl, you must be mad,
            What happened to the sweet love you and me had?"<br>
            Against the door he leans and starts a scene,
            And his tears fall and burn the garden green
            And so castles made of sand,<br>
            Fall in the sea, eventually
            A little Indian brave who before he was ten,
            Played war games in the woods with his Indian friends,<br>
            And he built a dream that when he grew up,
            He would be a fearless warrior Indian Chief
            Many moons passed and more the dream grew stronger,<br>
            Until tomorrow, he would sing his first war song,<br>
            And fight his first battle, but something went wrong,<br>
            Surprise attack killed him in his sleep that night<br>
            And so castles made of sand,
            Melts into the sea, eventually
            There was a young girl, whose heart was a frown,<br>
            'Cause she was crippled for life, and she couldn't speak a sound
            And she wished and prayed she could stop living,<br>
            So she decided to die
            She drew her wheel chair to the edge of the shore, and to her legs she smiled
            "You won't hurt me no more"<br>
            But then a sight she'd never seen made her jump and say
            "Look, a golden winged ship is passing my way"<br>
            And it really didn't have to stop, it just kept on going<br>
            And so castles made of sand
            Slips into the sea, eventually</p></center>
